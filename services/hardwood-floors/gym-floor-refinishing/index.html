                            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Our gym floor refinishing service is specifically designed for high-traffic sports flooring in basketball courts, volleyball courts, and fitness centers. We understand the unique demands placed on gym floors and use specialized equipment and materials to restore safety, performance, and appearance without disrupting athletic schedules.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Unlike residential hardwood floor refinishing, gym floor work requires faster drying times, enhanced durability, and specific surface characteristics that perform well under athletic use. Our team specializes in working during off-hours to minimize impact on gym operations while delivering premium results.</p>
