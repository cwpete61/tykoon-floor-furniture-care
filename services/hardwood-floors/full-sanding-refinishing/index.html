                            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Full sanding and refinishing is the most comprehensive method for restoring hardwood floors. This process removes all existing finish, imperfections, and a thin layer of wood to create a completely smooth surface ready for custom staining and a new protective finish. It's ideal for floors with significant wear, including deep scratches, water damage, gum, or pet stains that can't be addressed with lighter maintenance services.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Our dustless sanding technology minimizes mess and airborne particles, making it suitable for occupied homes and businesses in Los Angeles. We sand to the bare wood, apply your choice of premium stain, and finish with multiple coats of high-durability polyurethane. The result is a like-new hardwood floor that can last for years without needing additional work.</p>
